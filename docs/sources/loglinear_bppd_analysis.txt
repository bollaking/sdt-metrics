Analysis of loglinear_bppd
===========================

Abstract
--------

B''D is generally acknowledged as being the preferred and
robust nonparametric measure of decision bias. Despite its popularity,
B''D has an Achilles' heel with boundary cases where it loses sensitivity.
Applying a loglinear transform to B''D fixes the boundary cases and is
otherwise benign.

Introduction
-------------

When the parametric assumptions of `c` do not hold a nonparametric 
alternative is needed. In the literature a multitude of measures 
are available, including but not limited to: B'H, B'', B''d, and 
B_MZ [SEE1997]_, [HODOS1970]_, [GRIER1971]_, [DONALDSON1992]_, 
[ZHANG2005]_. Of these B''d is the most highly recommended [SEE1997]_, 
[SZALMA]_. It’s creator and origins stem from memory recognition 
research [DONALDSON1992]_, and subsequent theoretical and empirical 
comparisons have shown it to be robust in vigilance settings [SEE1997]_ 
and that it yields accurate estimates when data is collapsed or grouped 
[MACMILLAN1990]_ and [SNODGRASS1998]_ (secondary citation from [SEE1997]_). 

B''d is calculated from hit and false alarm rates and 
is well behaved over most of its domain. The exception 
being at the hit and false alarm rates boundaries B''d 
loses sensitivity. The plot below depicts B''d versus `c`. 
The 121 points reflect factorial combinations of hit 
rates between 0 and 1 at .1 increments and false alarm 
rates between 0 and 1 at .1 increments.

Formula for B''D                                  
-------------------------------------

Examing how B''d is computed reveals some insight into this phenomena. 
B''d is a function of pHI and pFA (hit rate and false alarm rate 
respectively),

::

                      (1-pHI)(1-pFA) - pHI*pFA
    B''D(pHI, pFA) = --------------------------
                      (1-pHI)(1-pFA) + pHI*pFA
           
        where,
           pHI = HI/(HI+MI)
           pFA = FA/(FA+CR)


Boundary conditions that equate to 1                                  
--------------------------------------

Losses of sensitivity occur on the boundaries. B''D always yields 1 when:

::

                                  (1-pFA)
    B''D(pHI = 0, 0 < pFA < 1) = ---------
                                  (1-pFA)
            

Regardless of the actually false alarm rate B''D yields 1. A valid 
measure of response bias should correlate with the false alarm rate 
under these circumstances. B''D is also 1 when:

::
  
                                  (1-pHI)
    B''D(pFA = 0, 0 < pHI < 1) = ---------
                                  (1-pHI)

                                  
Boundary conditions that equate to -1                                  
--------------------------------------

On the other boundaries B''D always becomes -1,

::
  
                                  -pFA
    B''D(pHI = 1, 0 < pFA < 1) = ------
                                   pFA

and when,
::

                                  -pHI
    B''D(pFA = 1, 0 < pHI < 1) = ------
                                   pHI

Suggested Correction
---------------------

Here a correction to B''D is suggested. When calculating d’ a common 
treatment of extreme values is to apply a loglinear transformation to 
the hit rate and false alarm rates [HAUTUS1995]_. The transformation 
calculates hit rate as,

::

    pHI = (HI+0.5)/(HI+MI+1)


and the false alarm rate as,

::

    pFA = (FA+0.5)/(FA+CR+1)

The effect is that the rates are compressed but maintain interval 
scaling. The loglinear corrected values of `d'` will always be of 
slightly lower magnitude due to the compression but the result is a 
well accepted measure of sensitivity. Similar treatments also apply 
to `beta` and `c`. Here, I suggest the loglinear transformation can 
be applied to B''D to correct the boundary condition problems 
describe above and the consequences to non-boundary values of pHI 
and pFA are negligible. 

The following scatter matrix demonstrates how the loglinear 
transformation corrects the boundary of B''D. It also demonstrates 
that over most of its range B''D (`bppd`) and the loglinear B''D 
(`loglinear_bppd`) are highly correlated.

Applying the transformation alleviates the boundary 
sensitivity problems. Examining `bppd` and `loglinear_bppd` in ROC 
space provides further reassurance.

The x and y axes are showing false alarm counts and hit counts 
respectively. 

Correlation between `bppd` and `loglinear_bppd`
------------------------------------------------

As suggested by the above figures `bppd`
and `loglinear_bppd` are highly correlated.

The plot below depicts cases where the boundary conditions are excluded.

    :align: center
    :height: 400px
    :alt: fscatter(bppd_X_bppdp,trend=linear,NoBoundaryCases).png
    
When the prevalence rate drops from chance to 10% (5 true events, 45 
false events) the correlation between `bppd` and `loglinear_bppd` 
yields an R^2 of .9910 across the non-boundary cases.

    :alt: fscatter(bppd_X_bppdp,trend=linear,NoBoundaryCases,10prevalence).png

Maximum magnitudes of `loglinear_bppd`
--------------------------------------

The new measure  asymptotically approaches -1 when the observed 
hit rate is 1 and the observed false alarm rate is 1 as the 
number of events increases, and asymptotically approaches 1 when 
the observed hit rate is 0 and the observed false alarm rate is 
0.

    max(|B''D|) = B''D| ------------, ------------ |
                       \ 2(HI+MI+1)    2(FA+CR+1) /

Caveat with non-equivalent prevalence rates
--------------------------------------------

When the prevalence rate is 50% the response bias is as expected 
to an observed hit rate of 1 and false alarm rate of 0 is the 
prevalence rate shifts from 50% the response bias also shifts:

    >>>             #  HI, MI, CR, FA
    >>> loglinear_bppd(10, 0,  10,  0)
    -3.9981245827275e-16
    >>> loglinear_bppd(10, 0,  11,  0)
    0.045454545454545026
    >>> loglinear_bppd(10, 0,  12,  0)
    0.08695652173912993
    >>> loglinear_bppd(10, 0,  13,  0)
    0.12499999999999958
    >>> loglinear_bppd(10, 0,  14,  0)
    0.15999999999999956

The loglinear transformed false alarm rates decrease in 
proportion to the loglinear hit rate the bias shifts quite 
quickly because the isopleths in this region of ROC space 
are particularly steep. A similiar shift occurs when the
hit observed hit rate is 0 and the observed false alarm
rate is 1.

This also occurs with `loglinear_c` although the isopleths 
are not quite as problematic:

    >>>          #  HI, MI, CR, FA
    >>> loglinear_c(10,  0, 10,  0)
    -1.0436096431476471e-14
    >>> loglinear_c(10,  0, 11,  0)
    0.020521384119198904
    >>> loglinear_c(10,  0, 12,  0)
    0.0391017058301415
    >>> loglinear_c(10,  0, 13,  0)
    0.056060731747756054
    >>> loglinear_c(10,  0, 14,  0)
    0.07164650351337443

Sometimes the distinction between a bug and a feature is
